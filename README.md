# Linea Equation JavaFX application

This project was built using Java language, JavaFX library and InteliJ IDEA enviroment.

The Java application allows to enter and display the solution to a system of linear equations. 
The application computes the LU factorization of the matrix with pivoting and computes the inverse of the matrix system.
The results of a successful computation might be saved. The application allows the user to load a previously saved computation.
Catching and handling exceptions are provided.
